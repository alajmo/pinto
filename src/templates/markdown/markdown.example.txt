# mani

`mani` is a tool that helps you manage multiple repositories. It's helpful when
you are working with microservices or multi-project system and libraries and
want a central place for pulling all repositories and running commands over the
different projects. You specify projects and commands in a yaml config and then
run the commands over all or a subset of the projects.

## Features

- Clone multiple repositories in one command
- Run commands over multiple projects
- Declarative configuration
- Single binary - Supports auto-completion

## Install

`mani` is available on Linux and Mac.

- Binaries are available as tarballs in the release page.
- Build from source:
  1.  Clone the repo
  2.  Add the following command in your go.mod file
      ```text
      replace (
        github.com/alajmo/mani => MY_MANI_CLONED_GIT_REPO
      )
      ```
  3.  Build and run the executable
      ```shell
      go build
      ```

### Auto-completion

#### Bash

Auto-complete requires [bash-completion](https://github.com/
    scop/bash-completion#installation).

There's two ways to add `mani` auto-completion:

- Source the completion script in your `~/.bashrc` file:

  `echo 'source <(mani completion)' >>~/.bashrc`

or

- Add the completion script to the `/etc/bash_completion.d directory:`

  `mani completion >/etc/bash_completion.d/mani`

#### Zsh

Coming.

## Usage

Checkout the [example](/example) directory to see how it can be used.

```
mani is a tool used to manage multiple repositories

Usage:
  mani [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Output shell completion code for bash
  exec        Execute arbitrary commands
  help        Help about any command
  info        Print configuration file path
  init        Initialize a mani repository
  list        List projects, commands and tags
  run         Run commands
  sync        Clone repositories and add to gitignore
  version     Print version/build info

Flags:
  -c, --config string   config file
  -h, --help            help for mani

Use "mani [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Create a New Mani Repository

Run the following command inside a directory to initialize a mani repo:

```sh
$ mani init
```

This will generate two files:

- `mani.yaml`: contains projects and custom commands. Any sub-directory that has a
  `.git` inside it will be included (add flag `--auto-discovery=false`
   to turn off this feature).
- `.gitignore`: includes the projects specified in `mani.yaml` file.

It can be helpful to initialize the `mani` repository as a git repository,
   so that your teammates can easily download the `mani` repository and run `mani sync`
   to clone all repositories and get the same project setup as you.

### Add New Project to Mani Repository

Add another project to `mani.yaml` and run `mani sync` to pull the repository
and add it to the `.gitignore`.

### Add New Project to Mani Repository

Add another project to `mani.yaml` and run `mani sync` to pull the repository 
and add it to the `.gitignore`.

### Run commands across multiple projects

```sh
# Run arbitrary command
mani exec 'ls -alh' --all-projects

# Specify projects using tags flag
mani run list-files -t frontend

# Specify project using project flag
mani run list-files -p project-a
```

## Config Structure

The `mani.yaml` config is based on two concepts: __projects__ and __commands__. 
__Projects__ are simply directories, which may be git repositories, in which 
case they have an url attribute. __Commands__ are arbitrary shell commands 
that you write and then run for selected __projects__.

```yaml
projects:
  - name: example
    path: .

  - name: idetheme
    path: frontend/idetheme
    url: https://github.com/alajmo/idetheme
    tags:
      - frontend

commands:
  - name: multi
    command: | # multiline command
      echo "1st line"
      echo "2nd line"

  - name: checkout
    args:
      branch: master # default value
    command: git checkout $branch
```

## Roadmap

`mani` is under active development and some of the things I aim to add/fix is:

- [ ] Add CRUD methods for project to config via cli (user-input)
- [ ] Add CRUD methods for command to config via cli (user-input)
- [ ] Add completion for zsh
- [ ] Add package to brew/snap/Ubuntu/Debian
- [ ] Add Windows support
- [ ] Add `--auto-discovery` flag to sync sub-command
- [ ] Remove duplicate flag auto-completion (both and without = showing)
- [ ] Add tests
